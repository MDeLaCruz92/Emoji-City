# How to play this game?
Unlike Candy Crash where you have limit amount of moves to use to complete each level, Emoji City has a move and time limit! Match 3 or more emojis to score enough points to complete the Goal Score and you win the round! Sounds fun right? ;D
Also to note, there is a "SHAMBLES" button that allows the user to reshuffle the whole board, but use it wisely because it uses up a move!

# Why did I decide to build this app?
This app is an inspiration from the popular match 3 game, Candy Crush. Throughout my college years, I have built 2D Array games, such as Battleship, GameOfFifteen, Connect4, and few other board games. By experiencing these kind of 2D Array games, I made myself more alert with handling edge cases, matching pairs, and creating efficient sorting algorithms.
